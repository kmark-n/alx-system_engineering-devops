#OSI model - 0pen Systems Interconnection model is a conceptual model. This is just a concept, it's not tangible. It describes layered communication and computer network desig and there are seven different abstraction layers:Physical layer, Data link layer, Network layer, Transport layer, Session layer, Presentation layer, Application layer.

#Different types of network: LAN, WAN, WLAN(wireless local area network), MAN(metropolitan area network), SAN(storage, small, server, system area network), CAN(campus, controller, cluster area network), PAN(personal area network)

#LAN network: Connects network devices over a relatively short distance

#WAN network: The internet is the largest WAN. A router connects LANs to a WAN.

#Internet: Global system of interconnected computer networks

#MAC address: NIC(Network Interface Card) is a computer circuit card that makes it possible for the computer to connect to a network.

#What is an IP address: An IP address uniquely identifies a device over the internet.

#Public and private address: A public IP address is assigned to computing device to allow direct access over the internet whereas a private address is the address space allocated by interNIC to allow organisations to create their own private network.

#IPv4 and IPv6: IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses wherea's IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses

#Localhost: used to refer to the current computer used to access it.

#TCP and UDP: TCP is all about reliability—packets sent with TCP are tracked so no data is lost or corrupted in transit whereas with UDP(user datagram protocol) packets are just sent to the recipient. The sender doesn’t wait to make sure the recipient received the packet—it just continues sending the next packets. If the recipient misses a few UDP packets here and there, they are just lost—the sender won’t resend them. (IT IS MOSTLY USED WITH LIVESTREAM VIDEO)

#TCP/UDP ports List: They only need one port for duplex, bidirectional traffic. The cells are; Yes, Unofficial, Assigned, No, Reserved.

#What is ping/ICMP: Ping is a computer network administration software utility used to test the reachability of a host on an IP network. It operates by means of a ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol). The process invovles sending an ICMP echo request to the target host and waiting for an ICMP echo reply.
