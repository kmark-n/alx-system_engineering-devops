In this project, we continued to build up the configuration of the web server issued in project 0x0B SSH. I was issued two additional servers, one to replicate the Nginx configuration of my original server, and another to set up an HAproxy load balancer on to manage both web servers.

Ever wonder how Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter and other web giants are handling such huge amounts of traffic? They donâ€™t have just one server, but tens of thousands of them. In order to achieve this, web traffic needs to be distributed to these servers, and that is the role of a load-balancer.
