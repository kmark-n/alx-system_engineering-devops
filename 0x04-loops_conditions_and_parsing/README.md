Loops, conditions, and parsing are fundamental concepts in programming that allow you to control the flow of execution and manipulate data. Here's an overview of each concept:

#Loops:
Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. They are handy when you want to perform a task iteratively or process a collection of data. There are different types of loops, including: 'for' and 'while'.

#Conditions:
Conditions allow you to make decisions based on specific criteria. They are used to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false. Common conditional statements include: 'if' and 'conditional operators';e.g '=='9equal to, '<''>'(less than, greater than respectively).

#Parsing:
Parsing involves extracting meaningful information from a given input, often in the form of a text string or structured data.
