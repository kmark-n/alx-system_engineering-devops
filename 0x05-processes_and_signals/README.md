# PID which stands for "process identifier" is a unique numerical identifier assigned to a running process in an operating system. It helps in tracking and managing individual processes.


# In computing, a process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. The works happens within an operating system.

#To find a process id it depends with the operting system..on linux, macos for instance you use the command 'ps' and on windows you can use the shortcut ctrl+shift+Esc

# To kill or terminate a process you can use the 'kill' command followed by the PID of the process you want to terminate. e.g 'kill 1234' on most unix-like systems or 'taskkill /PID 1234' on command prompt or powershell.

# A signal (in the operating system context) is a software interrupt delivered to a process to notify it of an event.

#SIGKILL - forces a process to terminate immediately.

#SIGSTOP - pauses a process's execution temporarily.
